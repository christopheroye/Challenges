# Coding Challenges

Highlighting and covering complex algorithmic coding challenges in preparation to build web applications with the same level of complexity that exist in the real world. These challenges help stretch my programming abilities to the extreme!

## Challenge: Image Blur 1

* Taking the concept of an Image and build a class for it using object-oriented programming techniques. The Image will use a two-dimentional array to store the pixel values for the image.

## Challenge: Image Blur 2

* From base of [Image Blur 1], building a data transformation on a data representation of an image. This will continue to work with object-oriented programming and multidimensional arrays.

## Challenge: Image Blur 3

* From base of [Image Blur 2], building an even more complex data transformation on the implementation of an image. This will continue to work with object-oriented programming and multidimensional arrays.

## Challenge: Linked List 1

* Building, using and transforming a complex data structure: a Linked List. Specifically this challenge reversed a Linked List. This challenge also involved leveraging a new data structure, a stack, to help perform the reversal.

## Challenge: Linked List 2

* Introduced the concept of a Linked List and performed a transformation on the data structure to build a new Linked List that was the reversed list. In this challenge, the linked list was reversed using mutation to modify the initial list that is provided.
